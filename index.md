Hello, I’m Bridget, a Cognitive Behavioural Therapist. I am a specialist in Anxiety Disorders. I believe it’s important that I help you to have agency over your life and to live a life more in line with your values.

You can overcome behaviours that are limiting your life and can quieten the overwhelming thoughts that you have.

<blockquote>
Bridget was excellent, I have completely transformed as a person. I am no longer worried about the little things as I have tools to handle them in a rational way. I am leaving today feeling so confident and excited for life.
</blockquote>

Book a no obligation free 15 min introductory call to have a chat and see if therapy with me is good fit for you.
