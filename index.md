Hello, I'm Bridget, a Cognitive Behavioural Psychotherapist. I am highly specialised in delivering evidence-based CBT treatments for depression and anxiety disorders. I have extensive experience working in NHS mental health services, voluntary organisations and in private practice. You can be sure to receive the highest quality care during your sessions. I believe it's important that I help you to become your own therapist so that you are equipped to manage the inevitable challenges of life. This is something my clients have valued.

In our first session we’ll compassionately explore unhelpful patterns of thinking or behaving that have developed and where they might have come from. My clients often report that this knowledge in itself is hugely beneficial and healing. Furthermore, this gives us a road map of how we change these unhelpful patterns.

I understand that exploring these difficulties can feel vulnerable and frightening. I’ll meet you with empathy and understanding and will create a safe space for you in our sessions. Your depression or anxiety is unique to you and I am skilled at tailoring evidence-based CBT treatments to the specific needs of my clients.
