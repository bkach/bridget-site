Hello Iâ€™m Bridget Barnes, a Cognitive Behavioural Therapist who specialises in Anxiety Disorders. I'm passionate about giving my clients more control over their lives and breaking through the wall of anxiety holding them back.

I firmly believe that you can overcome the behaviours that are limiting your life and can quieten your overwhelming  anxious thoughts through the process of therapy.

<b>Book a no obligation free 15 minute introductory call to get started.</b> 

Here's some recent client feedback
<blockquote>
Bridget was excellent, I have completely transformed as a person. I am no longer worried about the little things as I have tools to handle them in a rational way. I am leaving today feeling so confident and excited for life.
