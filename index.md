Hello, Iâ€™m Bridget, a Cognitive Behavioural Therapist. I am a specialist in Anxiety Disorders. I have extensive
experience helping people to have agency over their anxious thoughts, feelings and behaviours that are limiting their
lives.

Understanding how your anxieties have come about and why they continue to be a problem is the first thing we'll do
together. I then help my client's to overcome behaviours that are limiting their lives and to quieten the overwhelming
thoughts that they have. This has led them to living a life more in line with their values and doing things they didn't
think were possible. This is why I love my job so much!

"Bridget was excellent, I have completely transformed as a person. I am no longer worried about the
little things as I have tools to handle them in a rational way. I am leaving today feeling so confident and excited for
life."

Book a no obligation free 15 min introductory call to have a chat and see if therapy with me is good fit for you.
