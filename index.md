Hello, I'm Bridget, a Cognitive Behavioural Psychotherapist. I am highly specialised in delivering evidence-based CBT treatments for depression and anxiety disorders. I believe it's important that I help you to become your own therapist so that you are equipped to manage the inevitable challenges of life.

I understand that exploring these difficulties can feel vulnerable and frightening. Iâ€™ll meet you with empathy and understanding and will create a safe space for you in our sessions. Your depression or anxiety is unique to you and I am skilled at tailoring evidence-based CBT treatments to the specific needs of my clients.
