## Referrals

You can make an appointment by email, or via the online contact form below. I understand that reaching out for
psychological help can be difficult, so feel free to contact me in the way that suits you best. When you do get in
touch, please include your availability and a brief summary of your current difficulties.

I will try to contact you within two working days to arrange an initial appointment. In that session, we’ll explore your
current difficulties in order to find the best treatment options for you going forward.

## Fees

Your therapy appointment will last for 50 minutes.

The self-funded fee for individual therapy is £120. The fee will be payable via bank transfer prior to the appointment.

I'm recognised with the following insurance providers: Aviva, AXA, Cigna, and WPA.

## Cancellations

I operate with a 48-hour cancellation policy.

If an appointment is cancelled with less than 48 hours’ notice, the full fee for the session will be charged.

If you need to cancel a scheduled appointment, please contact me as soon as possible.
