## About Me

<img src="assets/images/avatar.png" class="dynamic-sizing-image" alt="Photo of Bridget"/>

I'm <b>Bridget Barnes</b>, an accredited Cognitive Behavioural Psychotherapist (British Association for Behavioural and
Cognitive Psychotherapists). I've trained at the Institute of Psychiatry Psychology and Neuroscience at King's College
London. I have a decade of experience working in NHS mental health services. Beyond this, I've also worked in voluntary
organisations and in private practice. I'm currently based in London.

I pride myself in providing you with the highest quality care during your sessions. Sessions are currently remote.

## My Approach to Therapy

I specialise in the following anxiety disorders:

- obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD)
- social anxiety
- health anxiety
- generalised anxiety disorder (GAD)
- phobias
- panic disorder
- low self-esteem or imposter syndrome
- perfectionism
- body dysmorphic disorder
- tricotilomania
- insomnia
- post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)

In our sessions we will use Cognitive Behavioural Therapy as well as third wave therapies including; Compassion Focused
Therapy and Acceptance and Commitment Therapy and Mindfulness Based Therapy.

Your anxiety is unique to you and I can offer you a bespoke, tailor made treatment plan to meet your needs. I believe
it’s important that I help you to have agency over your life and live a life more in line with your values. It’s
important that you l feel equipped with life long skills to manage the inevitable challenges of life.

Understanding how your anxieties have come about and why they continue to be a problem is the first thing we'll do
together. I then help my client's to overcome behaviours that are limiting their lives and to quieten the overwhelming
thoughts that they have. My approach is thoughtful, creative, and collaborative.

I understand that exploring these difficulties can feel vulnerable and frightening. The therapeutic relationship is very
important to me and I try to help my clients feel listened to, comfortable, and safe in our sessions.
