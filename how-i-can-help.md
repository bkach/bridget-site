I specialise in using evidence-based treatment for depression and anxiety disorders including obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), social anxiety, health anxiety, phobias, panic disorder, generalised anxiety disorder (GAD), body dysmorphic disorder and PTSD. I work hard to tailor evidence-based treatments to the specific needs of my clients in an effective way.

I see my therapeutic role as working together with my clients to better understand their current difficulties, to compassionately explore how these might have come about, to identify what might be maintaining them and to think about ways in which we can challenge them. I believe in the importance of the therapeutic relationship and endeavour to help my clients feel comfortable and safe in their sessions. I think that my approach is thoughtful, creative and collaborative. I find my job very rewarding and love seeing people's lives improve through therapy.
