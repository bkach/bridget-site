I specialise in treating anxiety disorders such as OCD, social anxiety, heath anxiety phobias, panic disorder and PTSD. I am highly experienced in using evidence-based treatment for depression and anxiety disorders such as OCD, social anxiety, phobias, panic disorder, generalised anxiety, health anxiety, stress, BDD and PTSD. I am particularly passionate about working with OCD and Social Anxiety.

My approach to therapy is compassionate and focused on building a trustworthy therapeutic alliance to support change. I strongly believe each client is an expert in their story and my role is to facilitate exploration, and bring you closer to your goals by using my therapeutic expertise. I am passionate about my job, and about helping others succeed.
