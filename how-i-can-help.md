I specialise in using evidence-based treatment for depression and anxiety disorders such as OCD, social anxiety, heath anxiety, phobias, panic disorder and PTSD. I am particularly passionate about helping clients with OCD and Social Anxiety.

My approach to therapy is compassionate and focused on building a trustworthy therapeutic relationship to support change. I strongly believe each client is an expert in their story. My role is to facilitate exploration with that story using an evidence-based approach. I believe this will bring clients closer to their goals. I am passionate about my job, and about helping others succeed.
