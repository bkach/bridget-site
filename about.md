I'm <b>Bridget Barnes</b>, an accredited Cognitive Behavioural Psychotherapist (British Association for Behavioural and Cognitive Psychotherapists). I've trained at the Institute of Psychiatry Psychology and Neuroscience at King's College London. I have a decade of experience working in NHS mental health services. Beyond this, I've also worked in voluntary organisations and in private practice. I'm currently based in London.

I pride myself in providing you with the highest quality care during your sessions. Sessions are currently remote.
