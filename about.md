## About Me

<img src="assets/images/avatar.png" class="dynamic-sizing-image" alt="Photo of Bridget"/>

I'm <b>Bridget Barnes</b>, an accredited Cognitive Behavioural Psychotherapist (British Association for Behavioural and Cognitive Psychotherapists). I've trained at the Institute of Psychiatry Psychology and Neuroscience at King's College London. I have a decade of experience working in NHS mental health services. Beyond this, I've also worked in voluntary organisations and in private practice. I'm currently based in London.

I pride myself in providing you with the highest quality care during your sessions. Sessions are currently remote.

## My Approach to Therapy

I specialise in using evidence-based treatment for depression and anxiety disorders including obsessive compulsive
disorder (OCD), social anxiety, health anxiety, phobias, panic disorder, generalised anxiety disorder (GAD), body
dysmorphic disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). I work hard to tailor evidence-based treatments to the
specific needs of my clients.

I work with my clients to help them better understand their current difficulties.
We'll compassionately explore how these difficulties might have come about, identify what might be maintaining them, and challenge them together. My approach is thoughtful, creative, and collaborative.

A trustworthy therapeutic relationship is important to me and I try to help my clients feel listened to, comfortable, and safe in their sessions.
I love seeing people's lives improve through therapy, and it's something I'm passionate about.
