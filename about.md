    <p>I'm <b>Bridget Barnes</b>, an accredited Cognitive Behavioural Psychotherapist (British Association for Behavioural and Cognitive Psychotherapists).

  <h2 style="margin-top: 0; color: #fff;">My Approach to Therapy</h2>
  <p>I specialise in the following anxiety disorders:</p>
  <ul style="columns: 2; -webkit-columns: 2; -moz-columns: 2; max-width: 600px; margin-bottom: 1.5em;">
    <li>Obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD)</li>
    <li>Social anxiety</li>
    <li>Health anxiety</li>
    <li>Generalised anxiety disorder (GAD)</li>
    <li>Phobias</li>
    <li>Panic disorder</li>
    <li>Low self-esteem or imposter syndrome</li>
    <li>Perfectionism</li>
    <li>Body dysmorphic disorder</li>
    <li>Tricotilomania</li>
    <li>Insomnia</li>
    <li>Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>In our sessions we will use Cognitive Behavioural Therapy as well as third wave therapies including: Compassion Focused Therapy, Acceptance and Commitment Therapy, and Mindfulness Based Therapy.</p>
  <p>Your anxiety is unique to you and I can offer you a bespoke, tailor made treatment plan to meet your needs. I believe it's important that I help you to have agency over your life and live a life more in line with your values. It's important that you feel equipped with life long skills to manage the inevitable challenges of life.</p>
  <p>Understanding how your anxieties have come about and why they continue to be a problem is the first thing we'll do together. I then help my clients to overcome behaviours that are limiting their lives and to quieten the overwhelming thoughts that they have. My approach is thoughtful, creative, and collaborative.</p>
  <p>I understand that exploring these difficulties can feel vulnerable and frightening. The therapeutic relationship is very important to me and I try to help my clients feel listened to, comfortable, and safe in our sessions.</p>
