# Referrals

I understand that seeking psychological help can be a difficult task and a referral to our service can be made by phone or via our online contact form below.When you contact me for the first time, please provide me with your name, contact details, when you would like to be seen and a brief summary of your current difficulties.

I will endeavour to contact you within two working days to arrange an initial appointment to explore your current difficulties and to discuss possible treatment options.

# Fees

Unless agreed otherwise, your therapy appointment will last for 50 minutes. The self-funded fee for individual therapy is £150. The fee will be payable in cash upon arrival or bank transfer prior to the appointment.

# Cancellations

I operate with a 48-hour cancellation policy.

This means that any appointments that are cancelled with less than 48 hours’ notice will be charged in full. If you need to cancel a scheduled appointment, please contact me as soon as possible using the contact details that will be provided.
