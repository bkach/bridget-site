## Referrals
You can make an appointment by email, phone, or via the online contact form below. I understand that seeking psychological help can be a difficult task, so feel free to contact me in the way that suits you best. When you do get in touch please provide me with your name, contact details, availability, and a brief summary of your current difficulties.

I will try to contact you within two working days to arrange an initial appointment. In that session, we'll explore your current difficulties and discuss possible treatment options.

## Fees
The self-funded fee for each therapy session is £150. The fee will be payable in cash upon arrival or bank transfer prior to the appointment.

## Appointment Duration
Unless agreed otherwise, your therapy appointment will last for 50 minutes.

## Cancellations
I operate with a 48-hour cancellation policy.

This means that any appointments that are cancelled with less than 48 hours’ notice will be charged in full. If you need to cancel a scheduled appointment, please contact me as soon as possible.
