## Referrals
You can make an appointment by email, or via the online contact form below. I understand that seeking psychological help can be a difficult task, so feel free to contact me in the way that suits you best. When you do get in touch please provide me with your name, contact details, availability, and a brief summary of your current difficulties.

I will try to contact you within two working days to arrange an initial appointment. In that session, we’ll explore your current difficulties and discuss possible treatment options.

## Fees
Unless agreed otherwise, your therapy appointment will last for 50 minutes.

The self-funded fee for individual therapy is £150. The fee will be payable via bank transfer prior to the appointment.

## Cancellations
I operate with a 48-hour cancellation policy.

This means that any appointments that are cancelled with less than 48 hours notice will be charged in full.

If you need to cancel a scheduled appointment, please contact me as soon as possible.
